## 1) The 3 “modes” of the website

Think of the app like a building with 3 areas:

1. **Public area** (anyone can enter)
   - You can read about LAUMGA, see events, news, and contact information.

2. **Member area** (you need to log in)
   - You can manage your mandate (recurring pledge), view alumni leadership directory, and browse the gallery.

3. **Admin area** (special access)
   - Admins manage members, approvals, content, mandates, roles, audit logs, and alerts.

## 3) Member Area (after you log in) — Regular User

After you log in, the top menu changes. You’ll see:

- **My Mandate**
- **Alumni**
- **Gallery**
- Plus a **Log Out** button

### A) My Mandate (your recurring pledge)

“My Mandate” is where you manage your recurring contribution.

#### 1) Start a mandate (first time)

1. Go to **My Mandate**.
2. Click **Start a Mandate** (or similar).
3. Choose a pledge tier (examples: Supporter / Builder / Guardian / Custom).
4. Confirm the amount.
5. Continue to complete the setup.

#### 2) Adjust your pledge

If you want to change your pledge amount/tier:

1. Open **My Mandate**.
2. Click **Adjust my pledge**.
3. Choose your new tier/amount.

#### 3) View your mandate dashboard

This is your “control panel”. It shows:

- Your current tier
- Your amount and schedule
- Your status (e.g., active/paused)
- Your transaction history

#### 4) Pause, resume, or cancel

You’ll see buttons for these actions depending on your status:

- **Pause**: stops the recurring debit temporarily.
- **Resume**: restarts a paused mandate.
- **Cancel**: stops it permanently.

Tip: If you’re unsure, use **Pause** instead of **Cancel**.

#### 5) View / download your certificate

If you have a certificate page:

1. Go to the Mandate area.
2. Open **Certificate**.
3. Download/print from there.

### B) Alumni (leadership directory)

The Alumni page helps you explore the leadership directory.

What you can do:

- Pick a **tenure/year** (like choosing a season of a show).
- Use the **search box** to find people by name, role, portfolio, or email.
- Open a profile to see more details.

If you can’t find someone:

- Try a different tenure.
- Clear the search term.
- Contact the secretariat if you believe records are missing.

### C) Gallery (photos archive)

The Gallery is a photo archive.

What you can do:

- Browse photos.
- Switch categories (example categories: Humanitarian, Conventions, Campus Life).
- View featured moments.

If a category looks empty:

- It may simply mean no photos have been uploaded for that category yet.

## 4) Admin Area (Admin Users)

Admins manage the whole organization’s data and content.

### How to enter Admin

- Visit the Admin section (usually via an **Admin** link provided to admins, or by going to the admin dashboard).
- If you do not have permission, you may see an admin login screen or be blocked.

### Admin menu (what each section means)

#### Core

- **Dashboard**: the admin “command center” summary.
- **Member Directory**: view members, profiles, and membership data.
- **Approvals**: approve/verify new registrations.

Typical approval flow:

2. Review the person’s details.
3. Approve (or reject) based on your rules.
